# Rain Water: A research repository

I like to take notes, I choose to put them here.

Welcome to my 'Rain Water' repository! This is where I store all my coding research notes and code examples.

I created this repository to help me keep track of my coding experiments and research by providing a central location for all my code snippets and notes. Whether I'm learning a new language or working on a project, this repository is the perfect place to store my ideas and code samples.

In this repository, I create subfolders for different programming languages, libraries, or frameworks, making it easy to organize my research and code snippets. I also use the issue tracker to keep track of my ideas or collaborate with others.

Feel free to contribute your own code samples or notes to this repository, or use it as a personal reference for your coding journey. I hope this repository helps you in your coding endeavors, and I look forward to seeing the amazing things you create with or discover in it!
